# Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - Food Buddies  
Borrowed from CS 196 :)

### What problem is your project trying to solve?  
1. A lot of food sits in your fridge and ends up expiring and going to waste because it is unused.
2. Often people want to try new dishes or make something that they are in the mood for, but don't know what to make.

### Describe your MVP:  
An app that lets people meet up for food. 

### What features make up your MVP?  


### What are the features discussed, but not in the MVP?  
- Meal Selection
    - Ingredient Preferences: Suggest older/unused ingredients and prioritize them
    - Criteria: Texture criteria
    - Review system for meals, factor into ranking system
    - Custom meal/recipe
- Fridge Tracker
    - See old/unused items
    - Alert user of expired/expiring items

### Which does the tech stack look like and why did you choose these over alternatives?  
Flask - Python familiarity  
Vue/Vuetify - Relatively easy to pick up on  
Heroku - Familiarity
