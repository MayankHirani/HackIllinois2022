## Inspiration

When we first arrived at the University, and didn't know anyone, the best way to socialize was in the dorm dining halls. We wanted to reignite the thrill of meeting new people on campus once again. Inspired by this motive, we came together to come up with the idea of Food Buddies, where people cannot meet new friends and share a meal with them. 

## What it does

After logging in, a user is first greeted by a list of meet-ups going on near them. For each meet-up, the restaurant or bakery is displayed, as well as the time, and the number of attendees. All attendee information is kept anonymous. When logging in, the user must login with their Illinois email, establishing security for our users. Users also have the option to create a meet-up and after choosing a restaurant and time, their meet-up will show up for others nearby. 

## How we built it

To create our project, all members of our team used VSCode to write code. We utilized a git repository to collaborate and organize our workflow. We built the backend using Python and a flask app. Our frontend used Vue and Javascript to create the user interface. Finally, our app was deployed to Heroku cloud computing.

## Challenges we ran into

We first tried to take on the challenge of creating it as a mobile application. After some difficult hours, our lack of experience with mobile development urged us to create a web-based app instead.

The Google authentication login was also very difficult to implement. With lots of research and trial and error, we eventually learned the ropes of it and were successfully able to include it in our project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

An accomplishment that our team prides ourselves in is our idea and innovation process. We came up with many good ideas and had meaningful discussions about them as a team. We continued this collaborative and constructive process to further develop features on our project. 

After our continous efforts, we are delighted to have a finished working product that aligns with what we invisioned. We are also very proud to each have learned more about various areas of software development.

## What we learned

Each of us deepened our understanding of software engineering. We learned the different parts of full stack development. In the frontend, we learned how to use Vue and Javascript to create the layout of an app. We also learned how to integrate the backend algorithms into the frontend part of the app.

## What's next for Food Buddies

Food Buddies has high hopes for the future. After thorough testing on the UIUC campus, we plan to deply our product to other busy campuses. We will also keep enhancing the features and quality of our app. In the long term, we want to keep maintaining the app and use feedback from users to keep providing for our userbase.
